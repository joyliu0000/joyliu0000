## 👋 Hi, I’m Joy
Welcome to my GitHub space!
I am a Data Professional, living with my beautiful 3 cats in Utrecht, with love of practicing yoga and making coffee. 

## 📘 My Journey

After **5 years in the corporate world**, I gained a strong understanding of enterprise data architecture. Most time, I have served as a Data Analyst or Analytics Engineer. However, I find that the life's flow is nudging me into the new direction - **Data Engineering**. I know I want to use my **startup mindset**: build fast, iterate small, stay curious. So I’m back here, rebuilding and experimenting.

## 🛠️ What I’m Working On

*   Data engineering skills
    
*   End‑to‑end data workflows
    
*   AI/ML experiments
    
*   Small, iterative projects that spark interest
    

## 🤝 Connect With Me

If you:

*   have a **data engineer** or **AI engineer** opportunity
    
*   want to **collaborate on a startup idea**
    
*   want to **talk data or tech**
    
*   want to **do yoga together** (I’m a yoga teacher)
    
**Cheers.** 🧘‍♀️✨
