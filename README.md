## 👋 Hi, I’m Joy
Welcome to my GitHub space!
I am a Data Professional with 5 years experience in the Netherlands, in banking industry. Most time, I have served as a Data Analyst or Analytics Engineer. 
Life's flow nudges me into the direction - to transition into **Data Engineering** and eventually to land in a role as a **full‑stack data professional**.

## 📘 My Journey

After **5 years in the corporate world: banking**, I gained a strong understanding of enterprise data architecture and served as a Data Analyst/Data . However deep down I know I want to use my **startup mindset**: build fast, iterate small, stay curious. So I’m back here, rebuilding and experimenting.

## 🛠️ What I’m Working On

*   Data engineering skills
    
*   End‑to‑end data workflows
    
*   AI/ML experiments
    
*   Small, iterative projects that spark interest
    

## 🤝 Connect With Me

If you:

*   have a **data engineer** or **AI engineer** opportunity
    
*   want to **collaborate on a startup idea**
    
*   want to **talk data or tech**
    
*   want to **do yoga together** (I’m a yoga teacher)
    

I’m based in **Utrecht, Netherlands**.**Cheers.** 🧘‍♀️✨
