## 👋 Hi, I’m Joy
Welcome to my GitHub space!
I’m a **data professional** based in Utrecht, living with my three lovely cats, and fueled by yoga and good coffee.


## 📘 My Journey

After 5 years in the corporate world, I’ve built a strong understanding of enterprise data architecture. Most of my experience has been as a **Data Analyst** and **Analytics Engineer**, but lately life has been nudging me toward a new direction — **Data Engineering**. <br>
To **showcase my potential as a Data Engineer** and bring real, hands‑on experience into sight for HR and future employers, I’m here on GitHub to code, build, and share projects that reflect my skills. <br>
At the same time, **actually building something small and working is very juicy for me** — it fits my work philosophy perfectly: build fast, iterate small, stay curious.
So this space is both my portfolio and my playground for side projects, experiments, and ideas that excite me, whether or not they lead to a job.


## 🛠️ What I’m Working On

*   Data engineering skills
    
*   End‑to‑end data workflows
    
*   AI/ML experiments
    
*   Small, iterative projects that spark interest
    

## 🤝 Connect With Me

If you:

*   have a **data engineer** or **AI engineer** opportunity
    
*   want to **collaborate on a startup idea**
    
*   want to **talk data or tech**
    
*   want to **do yoga together** (I’m a yoga teacher)
    
**Cheers.** 🧘‍♀️✨
