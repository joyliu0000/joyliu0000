## 👋 Hi, I’m Joy
Welcome to my GitHub space! Make yourself comfortable... <br>

I’m a **data professional** based in Utrecht, living with my three lovely cats 🐱, and fueled by yoga 🧘‍♀️ and good coffee ☕.


## 📘 My Journey

After 5 years in the corporate world, I’ve built a strong understanding of enterprise data architecture. Most of my experience has been as a **Data Analyst** and **Analytics Engineer**, but lately life has been nudging me toward a new direction — **Data Engineering**. <br>

To **showcase my potential as a Data Engineer** and bring real, hands‑on experience into sight for HR and future employers 😃, I’m here to code, build, and share projects that reflect my skills. <br>

At the same time, **actually building something small and working is very juicy for me** — it fits my work philosophy perfectly 🚀: build fast, iterate small, stay curious. <br>

So this space is both my **portfolio and my playground** ⚽ for side projects, experiments, and ideas that excite me, whether or not they lead to a job.


## 🛠️ What I’m Working On

*   Data engineering skills
    
*   End‑to‑end data workflows
    
*   AI/ML experiments
    
*   Small, iterative projects that spark interest
