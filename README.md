## 👋 Hi, I’m Joy
Welcome to my GitHub! Make yourself comfortable... 😉<br>

I’m a **data professional** based in Utrecht, living with my three lovely cats 🐱, and fueled by yoga 🧘‍♀️ and good coffee ☕.


## 📘 My Journey

After 5 years in the corporate world, I’ve built a strong understanding of enterprise data architecture. Most of my experience has been as a **Data Analyst** and **Analytics Engineer**, but lately life has been nudging me toward a new direction - **Data Engineering**. <br>

Hence, to **showcase my potential as a DE** and bring real, hands‑on experience into sight for HR and future employers, I’m here to code, build, and share projects that reflect my skills. <br>

At the same time, **building my own data projects** and **keeping up with modern data trend** is very juicy for me.

So this space is both my **portfolio and my playground** ⚽ for side projects, experiments, and ideas that excite me, whether or not they lead to a job.

If you:

*   have a **data engineer** or **AI engineer** opportunity
    
*   want to **collaborate on a startup idea**
    
*   want to **talk data or tech**
    
*   want to **do yoga together** (I’m also becoming a yoga teacher 🧚)

**Namaste.** 🧘‍♀️✨
