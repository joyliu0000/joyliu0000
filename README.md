## 👋 Hi, I’m Joy
Welcome to my GitHub space! Make yourself comfortable... 😉<br>

I’m a **data professional** based in Utrecht, living with my three lovely cats 🐱, and fueled by yoga 🧘‍♀️ and good coffee ☕.


## 📘 My Journey

After 5 years in the corporate world, I’ve built a strong understanding of enterprise data architecture. Most of my experience has been as a **Data Analyst** and **Analytics Engineer**, but lately life has been nudging me toward a new direction - **Data Engineering**. (Tiny part of the nudge comes from a recent reorganization, and big part from my growing interest in designing reliable, scalable data flows instead of only producing insights.)<br>

Hence, to **showcase my potential as a DE** and bring real, hands‑on experience into sight for HR and future employers, I’m here to code, build, and share projects that reflect my skills. <br>

At the same time, **actually building something small and working is very juicy for me** — it fits my work philosophy perfectly 🚀: build fast, iterate small, stay curious. <br>

So this space is both my **portfolio and my playground** ⚽ for side projects, experiments, and ideas that excite me, whether or not they lead to a job.


## 🛠️ What I’m Working On

* End‑to‑end Data Engineering: ingestion pipelines, ELT transformations, data quality testing, and workflow orchestration ![Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/NYC_Taxi_Pipeline-blue)
    
*   AI/ML experiments (Coming soon)
    
*   Small, iterative projects that spark interest

If you:

*   have a **data engineer** or **AI engineer** opportunity
    
*   want to **collaborate on a startup idea**
    
*   want to **talk data or tech**
    
*   want to **do yoga together** (I’m also becoming a yoga teacher 🧚)

**Namaste.** 🧘‍♀️✨
