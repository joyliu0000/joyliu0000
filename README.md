## 🧭 About Me

Data analyst / data scientist transitioning into **data engineering** and aiming to become a **full‑stack data professional**.

## 📘 My Journey

I created this GitHub during my **Data Science Master’s (2024)**.After **5 years in the corporate world**, I gained a strong understanding of enterprise data architecture — but I’ve always had a **startup mindset**: build fast, iterate small, stay curious.So I’m back here, rebuilding and experimenting.

## 🛠️ What I’m Working On

*   Data engineering skills
    
*   End‑to‑end data workflows
    
*   AI/ML experiments
    
*   Small, iterative projects that spark interest
    

## 🤝 Connect With Me
